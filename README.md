## Description

This project is a simple site built over 10 days in a team of 2. The user should have the ability to create and name their project folder, palettes, delete folders, delete palettes from the folder, and with a click of a button randomly generate a palette of 5 colors. The site should save these projects and palettes on the backend server and will persist on refresh. If a user deletes a project or palette, it will remove it from the DOM as well as the backend. 

## Setup

Simply start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B-Coyle/Palette-Picker-FE-React.git
```

In the same folder you cloned the repository also clone the back-end repository with 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacobogart/Palette-Picker-BE.git
```

Once you have cloned the repo, to install the library dependencies cd into the folders just created and run:

```bash
npm install
```

First in the back-end folder run `npm start` in your terminal, you should see "Something is running on http://localhost:3000/".  Now opening a separate tab in the terminal cd into the front-end repository and run `npm start` you're default browser should open a tab to http://localhost:3001/ if not simply go to http://localhost:3001/ in your preferred browser.
